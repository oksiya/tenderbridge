# Swagger UI Manual Testing Guide - CORRECTED

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step manual testing of all endpoints with correct data structures

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Access Swagger UI
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 2. Truncate All Tables (Fresh Start)
```bash
# Truncate tables (in order to respect foreign keys)
podman exec -it tenderbridge_db_1 psql -U tenderuser -d tenderbridge -c "
TRUNCATE TABLE answers, questions, documents, bids, tenders, notifications, companies, users, email_logs RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;"

# Exit
\q
```

---

## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Database + First Admin)

> **IMPORTANT:** Create the first admin user directly in the database since there's no super-admin endpoint.

#### 1.1 Create First Admin User in Database
```bash
# Connect to database
podman exec -it tenderbridge_db_1 psql -U tenderuser -d tenderbridge

# Create admin user with pre-hashed password
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password_hash, role, is_verified, created_at) 
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'admin@system.com',
  '$2b$12$9TJVsFbk6K1kDoyrP6cv9e2G6xOzyQpytgWQcaE.kPLLbyqEocc.W',
  'admin',
  'true',
  NOW()
);

# Verify admin was created
SELECT id, email, role, is_verified FROM users;

# Exit
\q
```

**Password:** `admin` (pre-hashed in the SQL above)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Click Authorize (ðŸ”’) and paste current user's token

### Issue: 403 Forbidden
**Solution:** Check user role - only authorities can publish/award, only bidders can bid

### Issue: 422 Validation Error
**Solution:** Check required fields match the JSON examples

### Issue: Rate limit blocking too early
**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds for limit to reset

### Issue: Cannot see other company's bids
**Solution:** This is correct - bidders only see their own bids until tender is awarded
