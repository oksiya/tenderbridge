## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized" errors
**Solution:** Click "Authorize" button and paste your JWT token

### Issue: "422 Validation Error"
**Solution:** Check required fields in the JSON payload

### Issue: Rate limiting kicking in too early
**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds and try again

### Issue: File upload fails
**Solution:** Ensure file size is under limit (check config)

### Issue: Cache not working (responses equally fast)
**Solution:** This is fine - with small dataset, database is already fast
